Task:
Given the historic energy usage of more than 1400 buildings over a span of 1 year, 
predict the future energy usage. This will then be compared to the actual energy usage
with efficiency process to understand the cost and energy savings.

Approach:
- energy forecasting problem -> regression problem
- use 1 year worth of data and predict 2 years 
- Evaluation metric: Root Mean Square Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)
